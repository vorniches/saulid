# Saulid Image Manipulator

This Python script reduces the quality of an image and resizes it to be 50% wider with a maximum width of 500 pixels. It is intended for fun.

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python saulid.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the path to the image file you wish to manipulate. The script will then process the image and save the manipulated version with a new file name in the same directory as the original image.
